                <h2>ðŸŒŒ "My Coding Odyssey" ðŸš€ </h2>
                <p><br></p>
                <p>My name is Joshua Leslie, and I am an aspiring computer programmer with a deep passion for coding, space, and video games.
                My journey into the world of IT started with a curiosity about how computers work and a desire to create my own video games and/or applications. 
                Recognizing IT's rapid growth, I decided it was time for a career change. <br>I then enrolled in the IT Programming program at Nova Scotia Community College, where I am currently in my first year.
                </p>

                <p> Throughout my studies, I have developed skills in programming languages such as Java, C, and JavaScript, continually seeking to improve my coding and problem-solving
                    abilities. I have even begun to self teach myself Python in my free time. I am also familiar with web development languages such as HTML, and CSS. <br>My goal
                    is to build a career in the computer programming field and to work on projects that will allow me to grow as a developer and contribute to the IT community.</p>

                <p>When I'm not coding, I enjoy playing video games, watching movies, and reading about the latest advancements in space exploration. I also enjoy spending time with my family and friends,
                     and I am always looking for new ways to challenge myself and learn new things.   
                </p>
