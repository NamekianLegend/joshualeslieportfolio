                <h2>🌌 "My Coding Odyssey" 🚀 </h2>
                <p><br></p>
                <p>My name is Joshua Leslie, and I am an aspiring computer programmer with a deep passion for coding, space, and video games. 
   What began as curiosity about how computers work has grown into a focused pursuit of building applications and exploring the full spectrum of IT development. 
   I am currently studying IT Programming at Nova Scotia Community College, where I continue to expand my skills and take bold steps into the IT universe.</p>

<p>Throughout my studies, I have gained experience in programming languages such as Java, C, JavaScript, and Python, and recently began learning C++ fundamentals. 
   My journey has also led me into backend development, where I’ve worked with Java Spring to connect front-end design with powerful server-side logic. 
   Alongside this, I’ve built a strong foundation in web technologies like HTML and CSS, and I’m continually refining my problem-solving and debugging abilities.</p>

<p>My goal is to build a career in quality assurance and software testing, where I can apply my attention to detail, problem-solving skills, and curiosity to ensure applications are reliable, efficient, and user-friendly. 
   I’m especially motivated by opportunities to uncover bugs, improve performance, and contribute to the overall stability and success of development teams through thorough testing and feedback.</p>

<p>When I’m not coding, I enjoy playing video games, watching movies, and following the latest advancements in space exploration. 
   I also value time with family and friends, and I’m always looking for new ways to challenge myself and learn something new.</p>
