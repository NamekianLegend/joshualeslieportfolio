This is the start of my portfolio page, it is a work in progress!! 
I will add to README the updated status of webpage as I work on it.

I have been slowly working on this as I complete exercises, assignments, and quizes in my classes. I have begun to start to personalize it more and more.
Still a long ways away from being done, but I feel I have made some good practice in the last couple weeks.

Plugged away at it a bit more. Put some finishing touches on contact page. Think I am about done with that for now. I want to add a form to it someday but for nowi have commented it out.
I tweaked the CSS files a bit to make some uniform changes across all pages.
